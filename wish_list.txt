- [] Variables in the correlation matrix in alphabetical order
- [] Quality of the sum scores are calculated based on other than SQP estimates (highlight the fact that SQP estimates are separate from other estimates)
- [] common method variance between the composite score and another variable, using the following equation: cmv(yi,ycs) = ri miΣ[(wk/σcs)mk rk]	- equation 7.6 (http://essedunet.nsd.uib.no/cms/topics/measurement/7/1.html)
- [] For now we exclude weights, but in the future we're like to have weights for the sum of variables and also for the quality of the sum scores. Should be the same weights.
