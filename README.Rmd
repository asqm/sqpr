The `sqpr` package gives easy access to the API of the Survey Quality Prediction [website](http://sqp.upf.edu/), a data base that contains over 40,000 predictions on the quality of questions.

## Important changes

After the feedback received at the [ESRA 2019 conference](https://www.europeansurveyresearch.org/conferences/overview), the `sqpr` package has been decoupled into two packages. The first will be responsible for only obtaining the data from the SQP API (`sqpr`) and the second will have all the measurement error corrections implemented separately. This way, measurement error corrections can happen independently of the SQP software for anyone who has other survey quality information. This new package is still under construction and will be uploaded as soon as it has working value. 

Currently, the `sqpr` package is not **usable**. This package is being tested on the new SQP 3.0 API and not on the published website of the SQP [here](http://sqp.upf.edu/).

If you have any questions, please contact us at <cimentadaj@gmail.com>.

## Installation

`sqpr` is not currently on CRAN but you can install the developing version of from Github with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sociometricresearch/sqpr")
```

## Example


### Registration and logging in

Register in the [SQP website](http://sqp.upf.edu/accounts/register/) and confirm your registration through your email.

First, load the package in R and provide your registered credentials.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(sqpr)
sqp_login()
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(sqpr)
sqp_login('your username', 'your password')
```

For details on the login process see the `Accessing the SQP 3.0 API vignette` from the package.

Once you've ran `sqp_login()`, you're all set to work with the SQP 3.0 3.0 API! No need to run it again unless you close the R session.

## Exploring the SQP 3.0 API

### Quick interaction

To explore the SQP 3.0 API quickly, `get_sqp` will be your main function. Assuming you know the study, question, country and language that you're looking for, you can make one call to the SQP 3.0 API. Let's try to get the question `tvtot` in Round 3 for Spain in Spanish.

```{r }
sp <-
  get_sqp(
    study = "ESS Round 1",
    question_name = "tvtot",
    country = "es",
    lang = "spa"
  )

sp
```

The country and language specification need to be in two and three letter codes respectively. A simple search on Google will yield two and three letter codes for country and language, feel free to explore them.

`get_sqp` also allows to specify several variables:

```{r }
sp <-
  get_sqp(
    study = "ESS Round 1",
    question_name = c("tvtot", "trstprl", "ppltrst"),
    country = "es",
    lang = "spa"
  )

sp
```

Additionally, you can also use regular expressions:

```{r }
sp <-
  get_sqp(
    study = "ESS Round 1",
    question_name = "^tv",
    country = "es",
    lang = "spa"
  )

sp
```

### Manual searching

The previos step assumes you're well aware of the studies available and some of the country/languages available. Alternatively, you can query all the questions in a specific study to check whether a specific question has quality predictions. Use `find_studies` to locate whether your study is in the SQP 3.0 database.

```{r}
find_studies("ESS Round 4")
```

Great! Once we have that, we can use it to find all of it's questions with `find_questions`. `find_questions` accepts the study that you're looking for and a string that specifies the questions that you're looking for. Let's search for all questions that have `tv` in the name:

```{r}
q_ess <- find_questions("ESS Round 4", "tv")
```

That might take a while because it's downloading all of the data to your computer. If you want to know all the questions in that study beforehand, use `get_questions("ESS Round 4")`.

Let's query further down to get the language for a specific question:

```{r}
sp_tv <- q_ess[q_ess$language_iso == "spa", ]
sp_tv
```

The hard part is done now. Once we have the `id` of your questions of interest, we supply it to `get_estimates` and it will bring the quality predictions for those questions.

```{r}
predictions <- get_estimates(sp_tv$id)
predictions
```

`get_estimates` will return all question names as lower case for increasing the chances of compatibility with the name in the questionnaire of the study.
